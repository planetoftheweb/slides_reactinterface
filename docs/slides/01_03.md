# Customizing Installation

<div class="slide-link"><a href="https://go.raybo.org/2sdu"><i class="fab fa-slideshare"></i> go.raybo.org/2sdu</a></div>

The setup for this project is a bit overkill, so lets pair it down a bit and install a few extra modules just like we would use on a real project.

# Removing Files

> >

I'm going to get rid of several files we won't be using on this project.

```bash
public/logo192.png
public/logo512.png
public/manifest.json
public/robots.txt
src/App.css
src/App.test.js
src/logo.svg
src/reportWebVitals.js
src/setupTests.js
```

We'll need to make some modifications to the following

```
public/index.html
src/App.js
src/index.js
```

<!-- .slide: data-state="layout-title" class="bg-dark"-->
# Index.html

```bash
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="utf-8" />
    <title>React App</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <noscript>You need to enable JavaScript to run this app.</noscript>
    <div id="root"></div>
  </body>

Remove

  manifest.json provides metadata used when your web app is installed on a
  user's mobile device or desktop. See https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/web-app-manifest/

  Notice the use of %PUBLIC_URL% in the tags above.
  It will be replaced with the URL of the `public` folder during the build.
  Only files inside the `public` folder can be referenced from the HTML.

  Unlike "/favicon.ico" or "favicon.ico", "%PUBLIC_URL%/favicon.ico" will
  work correctly both with client-side routing and a non-root public URL.
  Learn how to configure a non-root public URL by running `npm run build`.

  If you open it directly in the browser, you will see an empty page.

  You can add webfonts, meta tags, or analytics to this file.
  The build step will place the bundled scripts into the <body> tag.

  To begin the development, run `npm start` or `yarn start`.
  To create a production bundle, use `npm run build` or `yarn build`.

# React Icons

- [React Icons](https://react-icons.github.io/react-icons/)

```sh
npm install react-icons --save
```

> >

I'm going to start by installing a component library for React called React Icons. It's the easiest and most complete way to get different icon libraries installed in React.


---

# Importing an Icon

```
import { ICONNAME } from "react-icons/LIBNAME";
...
<ICONNAME />
```

> >

Once you've installed the library, whenever you want to use an icon, you can easily import it into the component. I'm a fan of Bootstrap Icons, so let's use those.

To get the name of the icon, you simply go to it's page and click on the one you want. It will copy the name you need to import.

```jsx
import { BsFillBootstrapFill } from "react-icons/bs";

<h1 className="text-5xl"><BsFillBootstrapFill className="inline-block text-red-400 align-top" /> Your Repos</h1>
```

## Installing Tailwind CSS

- [Tailwinds CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/guides/create-react-app)

```bash
npm install -D tailwindcss@npm:@tailwindcss/postcss7-compat @tailwindcss/postcss7-compat postcss@^7 autoprefixer@^9
```

> >

Now, let's intall Tailwind CSS. Version 2.0 just released so some of these installation instructions might be different, make sure you check out the page here.

Tailwind is a PostCSS plugin, so in addition to tailwind, we'll need postcss installed.


---
## Using Craco

```bash
npm install @craco/craco
```

```bash
"start": "craco start",
"build": "craco build",
"test": "craco test",
```

> >

Because the current version of the Create React App doesn't yet support PostCSS8, we have to do one more installation, although by the time you read this that might be different.

We'll install a utility that fixes this called Craco (Create React App Configuration Override), then we'll modify the scripts in our package.json to use these.

---

# Setting Tailwind Config

```bash
npx tailwindcss init
```

```js
purge: ['./src/**/*.{js,jsx,ts,tsx}', './public/index.html'],
```

> >

Tailwind requires a configuration file called tailwind.config.js and running the npx tailwindcss init command will generate one for you.

By default installing Tailwind will install all of the styles, even if we don't use them. Thankfully, we can use a plugin called purgeCSS to get rid of what we don't need. We'll need to make one change to the generated config file, so that it takes care of this.


---

# Modifying our CSS

```css
@tailwind base;
@tailwind components;
@tailwind utilities;
```

> >

To finish up the Tailwind installation, we need to replace the code in our index.css file so that it uses the different pieces of Tailwind CSS.

Now you can add Tailwind to your document.

```jsx
<div className="App container mx-auto mt-3 font-thin">
  <h1 className="text-5xl"><BsFillBootstrapFill className="inline-block text-red-400 align-top" /> Your Repos</h1>
</div>
```
